This high voltage source, capable of delivering up to 4 kV with a power output of 10 W, was developed at the University of Plymouth, UK, as part of a DARPA-funded project (HR001118C0125; https://www.highergov.com/contract/HR001118C0125/) investigating quantised inertia (QI). The system was integrated with a Raspberry Pi 4B, enabling automated measurements and remote control. The operation of the system was managed through a Python console application (main.py) without a graphical user interface (GUI), providing a straightforward and efficient way to control the device. The Python console application allowed for direct and flexible interaction with the system, making it suitable for both scripted and interactive operation. This design choice minimized complexity while ensuring the precise control needed for experimental workflows.

Quantised Inertia (QI) is a theoretical framework suggesting that inertia may arise from quantum interactions with the universe’s horizon. The project aimed to explore QI through controlled experiments, and the development of this high voltage source was essential for providing reliable and consistent electrical control in these studies.

This system, designed and implemented within the University of Plymouth, exemplifies a practical and focused approach to instrumentation, aligning with the specific needs of the research while remaining adaptable for future developments.
