High voltage source (0 - 4 kV, 10 W) integrated with Raspberry Pi 4B for automation of measurements and remote control.
Developed for a DARPA project HR001118C0125 on the quantised inertia (QI).
The program is interactive but without a GUI (console application).
It was created and tested in PyCharm IDE.
Electronic circuit can be provided by request.
